# Mujoco Simulate App with ROS2 Integration

This package utilizes the [pluginlib](https://github.com/ros/pluginlib) to make the [
`simulate`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/simulate) app from mujoco easily extendable. With this
plugin support, [mujoco_ros2_control](https://github.com/rxdu/mujoco_ros2_control) is integrated to enable a flexible
control interface of the simulated robot and sensors with the ros2_control framework.
